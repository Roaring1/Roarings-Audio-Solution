I used an AKAI LPD8.
This is a personal repo.
This will be updated as I find bugs.
Feel free to use this as inspiration.

Summarized, this is essentially a audio manager I created to work with my linux: nobara 43 KDE Plasma. I couldn't find any cool alternatives to Voicemeeter Potato and my other solutions on Linux after switching from windows, so, I made my own (well well well).

The "bin" folder  --> your bin folder: /home/username/bin/
the "user" folder --> your user folder: /home/username/.config/systemd/user/

..
If you have any questions, uhhh idk
